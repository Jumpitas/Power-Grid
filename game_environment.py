# bfs e ou nao preciso, se for e preciso ser updated, se as cidades tem que estar ligadas
# tbm falta a selecao inicial das zonas, nao sei como querem fazer isso mas as tantas e preciso outro dict
# que ligue a zona A,B ou C (ou a cor) a uma lista das cidades
# e importante para a selecao inicial das zonas do mapa, pq acho que se forem menos players, ha menos zonas, ha menos grafo tbm
# e se for e preciso reduzir para um subgrafo que todas para toda edge (i,j) -> i, j pertencam as zonas legais
